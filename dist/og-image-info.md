# Open Graph Image Placeholder

You'll need to create an Open Graph image for social sharing. The image should be:
- 1200x630 pixels
- Named `og-image.jpg`
- Placed in the `/public` folder
- Should include your name, title, and maybe a professional photo

For now, you can use any professional portfolio image or create one with tools like:
- Canva
- Figma
- Adobe Creative Suite

The image will be displayed when someone shares your portfolio on social media.
